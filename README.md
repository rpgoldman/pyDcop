# Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOP) in python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rpgoldman/pyDcop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rpgoldman/pyDcop)

pyDCOP is a python library for Distributed Constraint Optimization.
It contains implementations of several standard DCOP algorithms (MaxSum, DSA,
DPOP, MGM, etc.) and allows you to develop your own algorithms.

pyDCOP runs on python >= 3.6.

This repository is a fork of [the original repo](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/pyDcop), which is no longer maintained.

I am patching the module up for my own use, and am happy to share, but *I do not commit to maintaining this library*.
Nor have I put it on PyPI, so if you try to use `pip install` you will get a library that is sinking into bit-rot.
