# Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOP) in python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rpgoldman/pyDcop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rpgoldman/pyDcop)

pyDCOP is a python library for Distributed Constraints Optimization.
It contains implementations of several standard DCOP algorithms (MaxSum, DSA,
DPOP, MGM, etc.) and allows you to develop your own algorithms.

pyDCOP runs on python >= 3.6.
